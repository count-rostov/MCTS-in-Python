# MCTS-in-Python
A Version of a Program Like Alpha Go Zero

ToDo:
Update the network with states and actions from many games of self-play
# Initialize lists to store states, actions, and rewards from all games
all_states = []
all_actions = []
all_rewards = []

# Training loop
for i in range(epochs):
    # Play a game and get the states, actions, and rewards
    states, actions, reward = mcts.self_play(network, game, game_number)
    
    # Add the states, actions, and rewards to our lists
    all_states.extend(states)
    all_actions.extend(actions)
    all_rewards.extend([reward] * len(states))  # Assume the same reward for all states
    
    # If we've played enough games, train the network
    if (i + 1) % num_games_per_update == 0:
        loss = mcts.train(all_states, all_actions, all_rewards, epochs)
        losses.append(loss)
        
        # Clear our lists for the next batch of games
        all_states = []
        all_actions = []
        all_rewards = []
    
    game_number += 1

    # Step the learning rate scheduler
    scheduler.step()

Suggested Improvements:

Use of Residual Networks: AlphaGo Zero uses a residual network (ResNet) for its policy and value networks. You might want to replace PolicyValueNet with a ResNet.

Temperature Parameter: AlphaGo Zero uses a temperature parameter to control the level of exploration during self-play. This could be implemented in the self_play function when choosing the action.

Updating the Network: In AlphaGo Zero, the network is updated with states and actions from many games of self-play, not just one. You might want to modify your training loop to accumulate states, actions, and rewards from multiple games before updating the network.

Simultaneous Self-Play: AlphaGo Zero generates self-play games from multiple instances of the game simultaneously. This could be implemented with multi-threading or distributed computing.

Noise for Exploration: AlphaGo Zero adds Dirichlet noise to the root node to encourage exploration. You could add this in the self_play function.

Window of Past Games: AlphaGo Zero only uses the most recent games for training, discarding older games. You could implement a similar mechanism.
